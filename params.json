Convenient for transportation or shipment.\r\nDimensions and axis travels of original Prusa i3 preserved.\r\nTest print here:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZhU4h7qCJY\r\nMore Pictures here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/37863465@N03/8334662257/in/photostream/\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39889\r\nConsider: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40064/#files\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
