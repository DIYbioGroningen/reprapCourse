We found latest Prusa i3 printer design, the one Josef Prusa showed at Makerfaire this year in New York, for its elegant simplicity, but hinge like connection between Y axis assembly and frame needed improvement, in our opinion.
Using CAD software we reworked Prusa i3 design:

Laser cut frame was stiffen by adding two angle members connected to the rear side of Y axis assembly.
Original, printed Z Axis mounting parts proven to be easy to break, which is why we replaced them with stronger laser cut parts.
We did not like loose ends on Z Axis lead screw (similar to Printrbot design), therefore we added miniature flanged ball bearing on each side, to support lead screws on the top.
All printed plastic parts were slightly changed, we felt that we should give them additional strength and better cosmetic appearance.
Y axis assembly can be removed and installed back in a minute. Convenient for transportation or shipment.
Dimensions and axis travels of original Prusa i3 preserved.
